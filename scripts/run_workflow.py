To run this workflow:

1. Place your AlphaFold3 structure in: data/raw/cutin_synthase.pdb

2. Run individual modules:
   python scripts/run_workflow.py --step prepare
   python scripts/run_workflow.py --step screen
   python scripts/run_workflow.py --step simulate
   python scripts/run_workflow.py --step analyze

3. Or run complete workflow:
   python scripts/run_workflow.py --step all

4. Required external tools:
   - GROMACS (MD simulations)
   - PyMOL or MODELLER (structure manipulation)
   - FoldX or Rosetta (optional, for ΔΔG predictions)
   - DSSP (secondary structure analysis)

5. Results will be saved to: data/results/
